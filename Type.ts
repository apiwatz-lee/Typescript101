//Type --> Easy way to refer the different properties + function that value has

//Primitive Types : Number,Boolean,Void,Undefined,String,Symbol,Null
//Object Types: function,arrays,classes,objects

//Type annotations: Code we add to tell Typescript what type of value a variable will refer to
//Type inference: Typescript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to
